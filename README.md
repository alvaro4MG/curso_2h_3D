# 3D Platormer Unity Demo

Hi, I'm **√Ålvaro**, a Game Developer from Spain. You can check out my online portfolio [here](https://alvaro4mg.vercel.app/).

This project will showcase different implementations on my **3D Platormer Unity Demo**, a personal project aimed at improving my Unity skills and experimenting with different gameplay systems.

The base game was developed following the Level Up Game Dev Hub course "[Creating a moving character with Unity 3D](https://www.levelup-gamedevhub.com/formacion/cursos/creacion-de-un-juego-3d-en-unity-personaje-en-movimiento-2h/)".

This demo will be periodically updated as I add new features and polish existing ones.
